This is a readme about helpers we wrote to gather data during our project but were not part of the core
project. These files may need tweaking in order to work with the current version of the project.

These files are included for reference, their original locations were as follows:

in BODMAS/code
    csvHelper.py

in BODMAS/code/multiple_data
    malware_counter.py

in tab-clone
    remove_log_clutter.py
    js_divergence_plot.py
    Gaussian_diff_lineplot.py
    Gaussian_diff_example.py

in tab-clone/data
    visualHelper.py
